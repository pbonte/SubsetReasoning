# Stream UOBM

This is an extension of the UOBM benchmark that generates sequences of students that join the university over the year.
USAGE: java -jar streamuobm.jar <num of universities> <output>
EXAMPLE: java -jar streamuobm.jar 1 /tmp/out

This will generate five files per university containing students. These files can be streamed student at a time to simulate the joining of various students over the accademic year.
